# Discord-Bot-1.0.0
A beginner level javascript discord bot I created to start learning javascript.

As stated, I created this bot to dip my toes into javascript. I've wanted to learn another programming language for a little while now to diversify my skills. I would say that the code present in this bot is on the level of a beginner. I 100% believe there's a more efficient method for executing the functions present in this bot. I do plan on going back and revising the code and also adding more functions to make this bot more versatile.
